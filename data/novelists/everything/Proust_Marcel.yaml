  quotes:
  - entry: "What I fault the newspapers for is that day after day they draw our attention to insignificant things whereas only three or four times in our lives do we read a book in which there is something really essential"
    comment: "An astute observation of the fault of news media, which still holds incredible relevance a century later. In fact, it has become even more relevant today, as discussed [here](/essays/random-thoughts-on-marcel-proust-1/)."

- title: "In Search of Lost Time (Volume V): The Prisoner *and* The Fugitive"
  quotes:
  - entry: "Preparations for war, which the most false of all proverbs recommends as a way of ensuing peace, in fact create the belief in each of the adversaries that the other wants to break off relations, a belief which brings about that very breakdown, and then, once it has taken place, the further belief on each side that it was the other side who wanted it. Even if the threat was not sincere, its success encourages its repetition. But the exact limits of successful bluffing are difficult to determine; if one party goes too far, the other, which up to that point had been retreating, begins to advance; the first, unable to change its methods, accustomed now to the idea that the best way to avoid a breakdown is to seem not to fear it (as I had done this evening with Albertine), and, in its pride, preferring defeat to surrender, continues its threats up to the point where neither party can any longer retreat..."
    comment: "After the intricate dance the narrator performend with Albertine, where his threat to break from her was used as a mean to keep her closer to him, the narrator related his maneuvring to how a country used preparations for aggressive as a flawed mean to get the enemy to bend to its will."
