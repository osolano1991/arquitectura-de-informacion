sources:
- title: "My Struggle: A Death in the Family"
  quotes:
  - entry: "No less conspicuous than our hiding the corpses is the fact that we always lower them to ground level as fast as possible. A hospital that transports its bodies upward, that sites its cold chambers on the upper floors is practically inconceivable. The dead are stored as close to the ground as possible"
    comment: "This quote is from the beginning of the *My Struggle* cycle, a quote that sticks to my head for its observation that the deads are always stored as close to ground. I've never thought about it before I read it, and I can't answer why."
