- title: "Patriotism and Government"
  quotes:
  - entry: "I have already several times expressed the thought that in our day the feeling of patriotism is an unnatural, irrational, and harmful feeling, and a cause of a great part of the ills from which mankind is suffering, and that, consequently, this feeling---should not be cultivated, as is now being done, but should, on the contrary, be suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational men. Yet, strange to say---though it is undeniable that the universal armaments and destructive wars which are ruining the peoples result from that one feeling---all my arguments showing the backwardness, anachronism, and harmfulness of patriotism have been met, and are still met, either by silence, by intentional misinterpretation, or by a strange unvarying reply to the effect that only bad patriotism (Jingoism or Chauvinism) is evil, but that real good patriotism is a very elevated moral feeling, to condemn which is not only irrational but wicked."
    comment: "In this essay, Tolstoy reasoned against patriotism, which hasn't gone away more than a hundred years after he wrote the essay, and which continues to do harm to the world in ways Tolstoy observed from his own days.\n\n Indeed, the rise of right-wing conservativism around the world now suggests that we shouldn't ignore Tolstoy's warning at all."
